I've always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil' Mo. I'm excited to learn how to work on its famous <abbr title="Toyota 22 R Family - Electronic Fuel Injection">22R-E</abbr> engine.

## License Plate Holders

I replaced the old holders with reflective ones. The visibility of the pickup isn't the best, so hopefully this'll decrease the chances of being rear-ended!

## Lights

I'm starting relatively simple: replacing the rear and front lights. They were far too dim, so the updated lights are LED except for brighter headlights. The power consumption is still a little less from replacing so many incandescents with LED.

## Reflective Tape

It seems like most of the upgrades relate to safety. I guess that's to be expected with a car without traction control, <abbr title="Anti-Lock Braking System">ABS</abbr>, or even airbags. I used red tape on the back, so it looks like a third rear light. Then, I put white tape along the sides to blend into the paint. Finally for the doors, I placed the tape so it's hidden when the door is closed but shows when they're open to other cars.

## Stereo

The truck as two speakers, and one wouldn't make any sound. After working through every wire from the passenger-side speaker, I figured the issue was in the stereo itself. I picked up an aftermarket one at Best Buy and am trying to get it wired up. I think there's a ground issue but I'll deal with that tomorrow.
