I've always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil' Mo. I'm excited to learn how to work on its famous <abbr title="Toyota 22 R Family - Electronic Fuel Injection">22R-E</abbr> engine.

## Lights

I'm going to start simple: replace the rear and front lights. They're far too dim currently, so the first work I'll do is to replace those. While I'm at it, I'll also put reflective license plate holders on Lil' Mo too.
