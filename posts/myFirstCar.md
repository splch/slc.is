I've always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil' Mo. I'm excited to learn how to work on its famous <abbr title="Toyota 22 R Family - Electronic Fuel Injection">22R-E</abbr> engine.

## License Plate Holders

I replaced the old holders with reflective ones. The visibility of the pickup isn't the best, so hopefully this'll decrease the chances of being rear-ended!

## Lights

I'm starting relatively simple: replacing the rear and front lights. They were far too dim, so the updated lights are LED except for brighter headlights. The power consumption is still a little less from replacing so many incandescents with LED.

## Reflective Tape

It seems like most of the upgrades relate to safety. I guess that's to be expected with a car without traction control, <abbr title="Anti-Lock Braking System">ABS</abbr>, or even airbags.
