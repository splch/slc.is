title: Assembly Neural Network on Pico

I've been using the Raspberry Pi Foundation's products for almost a decade now, but they only recently released their [first microcontroller](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html). Their custom <abbr title="Raspberry Pi 2040">RP2040</abbr> has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I've been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.

> The goal is to code a very basic neural network in assembly.

I want to make a simple neural network, and luckily the Pico has a [multiplication](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0210/c/Introduction/Instruction-set-summary/Thumb-instruction-summary) instruction (unlike the 6502 processor). Additionally, [Stephen Smith](https://smist08.wordpress.com/2021/04/24/bit-banging-the-raspberry-pi-picos-gpio-registers/) and [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_Cbmf3z-U) have already demonstrated assembly running directly on the Pico. I took both their tutorials and created a more fleshed out assembly setup.

This is going to be a bit of a challenge, but I'm looking forward to learning ARM assembly and pushing the Pico to its limits!

In the collapsed files, I recreated the starter [_blink_](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/soft/blink.uf2) code in assembly.

Ensure that you have [pico_sdk_import.cmake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/master/pico_sdk_import.cmake) and the `assembly.s` file in the `add_executable()` function.

## Neural Network

I trained an identical model on a dataset in Python and transferred over the weights and biases to the assembly <abbr title="Neural Network">NN</abbr>. I might attempt to implement back propagation in assembly in the future, but for now, I'll stick with a basic NN.

I used UCI's [Wine dataset](https://kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) since it's popular and easily categorical. I preprocessed the data by dropping every column except *citric acid*, *volatile acidity*, and *quality*, and removing outlier data with a z-index greater than 3. Then I made all wines with a quality below 5 a **0**, and all wines above 7 a **1**. I used the remaining data to fit the nine tunable parameters (I really didn't have to worry about overfitting ðŸ˜‚) of the neural network and finally copied them into assembly. The file below will, with 82% accuracy, determine whether a wine is good or bad given its alcohol and salt contents.
