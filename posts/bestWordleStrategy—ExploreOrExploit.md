This post will derive an optimal Wordle-specific guessing strategy. The approach taken will be reducing the set of possible words a maximum amount for each guess; however, it doesn't make sense to keep reducing the set of words until the final guess, so we're reintroduced to our old friend, the [explore-exploit tradeoff](https://conceptually.org/concepts/explore-or-exploit).

The first question we need to answer is, given 6 guesses, how many should be exploring which consonants and vowels are and aren't present, and how many should exploit that knowledge to guess the word? These two options aren't completely exclusive, but a common problem I see in my own family, is exploring after only the first word and getting stuck in a rut of limited guesses.

This can be interpreted as an optimization problem: How many guesses maximize the exploration and exploitation value? Meaning, how many guesses should explore the possible letter combinations and how many should use that to guess the word.

Taking inspiration from the [Secretary Problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem), let's "reject" the first `$\div{N, e}$` choices and "accept" the next best. Meaning, let's not consider the first `$\div{6, e} \approx 2$` guesses toward our exploitation and then try guessing afterwards. This is hand-wavy because I mostly want to dive into the CS, but even this can be calculated… I'll maybe do that as well.

Another option is to maximize the gradient (<abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> people get hyped) over word-set size as the exploitation strategy. This would mean that you'd stop exploring letters after each following step stops reducing the set size as much.

Here's the list of all [wordle words](data/wordles.txt) as of writing this, though I doubt it'll change much. It'll be helpful to have in case you want to run your own experiments or follow along.
