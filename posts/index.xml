Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&amp;rsquo;s STS.</description></item><item><title>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</title><link>/posts/customqiskitgates.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/customqiskitgates.html</guid><description>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&amp;rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained.</description></item><item><title>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</title><link>/posts/manjarochromebook.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/manjarochromebook.html</guid><description>1.
