I'll use this post as a progress report of the Google Internship application process. The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don't know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications. 

# Snapshot Survey

**The survey autosaves**, so use the answer history to indicate confidence in some and confliction in other answers.

# Coding Exercise

1. Leave comments on code
2. Use descriptive variables names
3. Make test cases
    - I wrote a message to the Googlers in my tests
4. Leave feedback on the form
    - They say to not include identifiable information, but the Google account is associated with the form, so it can only help

# Candidate Questionnaire

There isn't much room for unique answering strategies here, but the time to show your stuff in writing has finally come. For all long-answer sections, be sure to fill it out thoroughly. Use Grammarly to verify writing style and leave feedback at the end per usual.

# Phone Interviews

The hosting round, where you match with Google teams, comes quickly and is at a first-come basis. Because of this, completing your phone interviews as quickly as possible is very important. The sooner you can progress to hosting the better in terms of obtaining an internship, in my opinion.
