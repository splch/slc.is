## Applying for Winter 2022
Title: Software Engineering Intern, Bachelors, Winter 2022

I'll use this post as a progress report of the Google Internship application process. The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don't know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications.
