[Ã½.is](https://Ã½.is) is now taken. This morning, I began rummaging through the NCIS' [Domain Rules](https://www.isnic.is/en/domain/rules#2) and found a list of all allowed single characters.

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Ã¡ Ã© Ã½ Ãº Ã­ Ã³ Ã¾ Ã¦ Ã¶ Ã°
```

After a few searches and captchas, I was surprised to that `Ã½` was available! I didn't wait long before paying that â‚¬31.90 fee ðŸ˜‚ It's very interesting that there was a single-letter domain left considering most of the others were registered in the early 2000s. I checked the WhoIs history, too, and nobody has owned it previously. Either way, I'm happy I have the shortest possible domain name now!

I have no concrete idea for what I'll do with [Ã½.is](https://Ã½.is), but I think a personal URL shortener would be useful. I doubt bots are testing these characters for spam, so basically any email from this domain would be rarely targeted. Having some email forwarding service attached to the domain could be helpful in this sense. This isn't a domain that others can visit due to the `Ã½` character being so infrequently used. Anything I end up using this domain for will most likely be personal.

I'll try to think of some reasons it'd be useful to have a Latin character in a URL, but in the meantime I'll enjoy owning a rare domain.
