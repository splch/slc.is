# [Résumé](data/resume/resume.pdf)

I'm a student at the University of California, Irvine and majoring in computer science. I enjoy studying at the edge of the field, so I've found quantum computing to be an exciting area to explore!

I'm always listening to or making music. But when I'm up for a challenge, I like to code all sorts of things. I make [chrome extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/splch?_category=extensions) whenever I need tools and I work on quantum projects when I want to push myself.

My current research interest is in how quantum will change optimizations like gradient decent. I'm actively involved in [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) but still need to study different methods of minimum finding. It'd be so cool to contribute to the field by 2030, the [50<sup>th</sup> anniversary](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01011339) of quantum computing, but who knows?

Changing pace, I recently got very interested in crowdfunding campaigns after learning more about [planned obsolescence](https://youtu.be/j5v8D-alAKE). I want to own resilient products like nice leather journals with titanium pens and the sort.

For the future, I want a job that enables me to travel to different countries' offices. A company like Google or IBM would be perfect in that sense. Both teams are making huge contributions to the field of quantum computing, so I'd love to be part of that growth. Whatever's in store, I'm ready!
