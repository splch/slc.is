I want readers to execute code I use anywhere in my blog. Recently, I added code that scrapes [DuckDuckGo's !bangs](/#Every%20Bang%20in%20DuckDuckGo); however, the reader would need to run the code on their own machine. It'd be helpful if they could have executable code embedded in the post.

I searched the internet for popular online <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment
">IDE</abbr>s and found those listed below. I wanted to compare features and languages to determine which I should use in my blog (if any).

| Name           | Website            | Languages | HTTP Requests |
| -------------- | ------------------ | :-------: | :-----------: |
| Replit         | replit.com         |    63     |      Yes      |
| Trinket        | trinket.io         |    10     |      Yes      |
| JDoodle        | jdoodle.com        |    74     |      No       |
| GeeksforGeeks  | geeksforgeeks.org  |    11     |      No       |
| Tutorialspoint | tutorialspoint.com |    107    |      No       |
| CodeChef       | codechef.com       |    54     |      No       |
| Ideone         | ideone.com         |    62     |      No       |
| Paiza          | paiza.io           |    31     |       ?       |

So far, I'm not happy with Replit's <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> on mobile devices, and Trinket has a great UI but a very limited number of supported languages. I don't want to include a feature in my blog that will limit me in the future.

It may prove useful for others to have a list of IDEs and their features, but I won't be including any in my website right now.

If I *were* to recommend one, however, I would vouch for [Replit](https://replit.com). I used their platform for the first two years of university and actually paid $5 a month for the Hacker plan. They're constantly innovating and adding unique and useful features. I just hope they can improve its appearance on smaller screens. When that happens, I'll have the difficult task of choosing between my seamless `code tags` and Replit's interactive embeddings.

Edit (9/25/2021) â€” I decided that in some cases running code is helpful, so I'm including Replit embeddings.
