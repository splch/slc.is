I've been using my old Game Boy Color a lot more now that I'm programming a GB game, so I wanted to clean up the handheld! This tutorial is the culmination of a few YouTube videos from [The Retro Future](https://youtu.be/fZ__K0QotW8) and [Odd Tinkering](https://youtu.be/2BmGMi0IEx4). I liked a lot of their tips, so I decided to add them and my own to this post.

## Tools:

- Phillips Head Screwdriver
- Cotton Swab
- Tooth Brush
- 99% Isopropyl Alcohol

   1.5. Unscrew 2 more screws under the batteries
2. Remove the back plate

   - Focus on the metal connectors
   - Thoroughly clean all button contacts
3. Clean the surface of the speaker
4. Dab alcohol around the volume dial and power switch
   - Actuate them to spread the alcohol inside
5. Use alcohol to clean the headphone jack
6. Swab the battery terminal with alcohol

Case:

1. Prepare a hot soapy water to submerge the case
2. Wash and brush the plastic in the water
3. Clean the speaker holes

Buttons:

## Reassemble

1. Read the **Disassembly** section backwards ðŸ˜‚
2. Screw in a [sequence](https://www.boltscience.com/pages/tsequence.htm) that evenly distributes the force

Now that the GBC is all cleaned up, it should last a few more decades!
