	1.5. Unscrew 2 more screws under the batteries
2. Slide the metal battery holder out of the case
3. Remove the back plate
4. Unscrew the 3 Phillips screws holding the motherboard
5. On the back place, unscrew the 4 Phillips screws holding the cartridge slot

## Cleaning

Battery Holder:

1.  Let the metal battery connector sit in vinegar until all the cleaning steps are finished

Motherboard:

1. Dip the cotton swabs in isopropyl alcohol
	* If the board is really dirty, use the tooth brush to scrub with the alcohol
3. Clean everything on the motherboard with the swabs
	* Focus on the metal connectors
	* Thoroughly clean all button contacts
4. Clean the surface of the speaker
5. Dab alcohol around the volume dial and power switch
	* Actuate them to spread the alcohol inside

Case:

1. Wash the plastic case in the sink with soap and water
	* Use a brush to clean every part of the plastic
2. Clean the speaker holes

Buttons:

1. Wash the buttons and their rubber membranes in the sink
	* Use a toothbrush to clean
2. Also clean the IR cover

## Reassemble

1. Read the **Disassembly** section backwards
2. Screw in a [distributed sequence](https://www.boltscience.com/pages/tsequence.htm)

## Enjoy

Now that the GBC is all cleaned up, it should last another 23 years!
