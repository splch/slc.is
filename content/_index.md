# Welcome to my site!

I'm a student and software engineer. When I'm not busy engineering away at my computer, I'll be researching quantum with IBM Qiskit or playing guitar.

The [Posts](/posts) page contains all my posts, [Music](/music) links to some recordings and AI generations, and [About](/about) serves as a repository for miscellaneous information _(contact, interests, etc.)_. There's also a [RSS Feed](/index.xml) if you're interested.

Have a look around and feel free to share! ðŸ¥³
