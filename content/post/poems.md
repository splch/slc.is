# Alexandre

Alexandre, my trembling wings.
Your dead are in the fields.

Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.

An earth that is not mine.

# Skies

A sky became a wave,
and suddenly the breeze -
azure floating on the hills.

![Sky](/images/sky.jpg)

Our music was not of a god or spirit, not of that colour of the sea.

# falafel

My falafel from the seas and palm-trees.
This magic, the stars have been held for.
Mysterious prophets and priests return to temptation.
Sleepy and strong, lay the falafel.
