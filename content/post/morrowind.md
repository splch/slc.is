In a world of magic, war, and a thousand other things, it's easy to forget the past. (That line was written by GPT-3 ðŸ˜‚) However, it is also true that forgetting a past world filled with magic and lore is difficult. This is why I'm so excited for the Skywind mod.

I applied as a writer for the team and am hoping to contribute in some way; but despite what happens, being able to play Morrowing in a way that complements my rose-tinted nostalgia is fine by me. Morrowind was the first game I saw that allowed interaction with the world's characters. In the early 2000's, this was a huge step forward for the gaming industry. Two decades later, we're starting to see life-like immersion in games like Cyberpunk 2077.

Skywind, despite being built on a 2011 engine, brings the world of Morrowind to a more modern age. The world is more open, with more choices, and the player can interact in natural ways.
