I began learning quantum mechanics with Professor Allan Adams on [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/8-04S13)! This will be an ongoing post about interesting things I learn, as a way to share a computer scientist's perspective on quantum physics as well as to hold myself accountable in finishing the course.

The first lecture taught me something fundamental about the term _superposition_. As I used quantum computers, I thought about the <abbr title="Quantum Binary Digit">qubit</abbr>s as being both 0 and 1 while in superposition; however, this is **false**. The qubit is in no meaningful state: not 0, not 1, not both, and not neither.

In the second lecture, this idea of superposition is again reiterated by the famous double-slit experiment, where an electron neither passes through the top nor bottom slits, neither both nor no slits. Contuining to experimentally demonstrate quantum properties, Professor Adams then proved [Bell's Inequality](https://https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) very simply as $$P(a \cup \overline{b}) + P(b \cup \overline{c}) \geq P(a \cup \overline{c})$$. Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, electrons' angular momenta in the _x_, _y_, and _z_ axes, which are either up or down, do not abide by Bell's Inequality. However, this **is** very surprising, because simple logic and integers must be flawed at a fundamental sense to not accurately describe quantum properties.

I'm tempted to take a [course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-yeeqmse01-quantum-mechanics-scientists-and-engineers) now, because doing problem sets for a course designed to be taken in-person is tedious. I also want a certificate😮‍💨. If the OpenCourseWare site is down, click <a href="/data/quantumPhysics.zip">here</a> to download the lecture materials.
