The TLD is controlled by its parent company or country. When choosing a TLD, consider the site to be strictly under the laws of the country that ultimate controls it. For example, if you use a <abbr title="Saudi Arabia">`.ae`</abbr> domain, with a single query from the monarchy, your site could be completely removed. On the otherhand, if you use a domain fromâ€¦ well let's get into it ðŸ˜‰

The <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr> outlined a [comparison of TLDs](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/08/02/domain_registry_whitepaper.pdf). They say that there isn't a "best" TLD since different domains have varying purposes, but I'd say there's definitely a top few to choose from. Here are a few takeaways from the report:

- `.com` and `.net` are owned by Verisign
- Domains under Verisign, and <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> in general, are controlled by the United States
- <abbr title="Country Code Top Level Domain">ccTLD</abbr>s are under the sole jurisdiction of their parent country

Now, the question naturally becomes: which countries have the best privacy and free speech laws? If the only avenue for domain takedown is through a local court, rather than through an arbitrator order or trusted notifier, that domain is only conforming to a single set of laws. Preferably those laws would be fair for the site owner.

The only domains that are soley controlled by federal courts are:

| Country |    ccTLD |
| ------- | -------: |
| Austria |    `.at` |
| Germany |    `.de` |
| Iceland |    `.is` |
| Russia  |    `.ru` |
| World   | `.onion` |

Of these, the few with the strongest laws for individuals and outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>'s [invasive policies](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf) are:

1. `.is`
2. `.onion`

What's left are two options, but only one for the <abbr Title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>. To capture the most internet users, the best option is to use a `.is` TLD; however, for true anonimity and control, a `.onion` is superior.

In most cases, the TLD you end up picking won't be too important, but I believe it's important to know who has the final say in a website's fate. If the United States felt so inclined, over 60% of the internet could go offline. Take it from this site, there are tons of great and short `.is` domains available, so be sure to check out [ISNIC](https://isnic.is)!
