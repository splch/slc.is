This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.

Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:

1. [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/quantumcenter/)
2. [Qiskit Global Summer School](https://qiskit.org/events/summer-school/)
3. [QuBes Camp](https://www.qmunity.tech/qubes-camp)

This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.

Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools. I will include Google Forms as graded quizzes and cover the most essential information with additional resources linked below.
