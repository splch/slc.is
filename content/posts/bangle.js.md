I was gifted a Bangle.js 2 watch a few months ago and have since fallen in love with its developer-friendly SDK.

The first project I began was ambitious as I attempted a Pokemon Battle watchface but the graphics are difficult to get perfect. I then moved to a health widget that reminds me to look away from my screen for 20 seconds and stand up / sit down for 20 minutes.

I realized that this widget should only run when I'm wearing the watch, so I then began work on a library to detect if someone is wearing the watch.

The development environment around Bangle.js is fantastic and has enabled me to have fun while adding features that are useful to me and the watch's battery!
