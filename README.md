# slc.is

I'm using this server for my own [blog](https://slc.is) and wanted to share the code. If you want to mess around with a server, learn Go, or just easily make markdown posts, this is the template for you.

I moved from hosting with Go to using GitHub actions to deploy on pages. This is more affordable and easier to maintain. I've preserved the other hosting method under the [`go`](slc.is/tree/go) branch.
